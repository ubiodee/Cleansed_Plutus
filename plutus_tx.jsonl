{"text": "<s>[INST] What is the expected result of following the steps to create a validator script using the Plutus-Tx-template repository? [/INST] The expected result of following the steps is that the above process will have created the validator.uplc script.</s>"}
{"text": "<s>[INST] How can you deploy and interact with your script after creating it? [/INST] To deploy your script, use cardano-cli. To interact with your script, use an off-chain framework such as cardano-transaction-lib or mesh. All these interactions are based on the Cardano API, which provides the capability to do off-chain work with a local running node.</s>"}
{"text": "<s>[INST] What does the term 'ledger language version' refer to in the context of Plutus? [/INST] The term 'ledger language version' refers to different versions such as 'Plutus V1', 'Plutus V2', and 'Plutus V3'. These versions are called 'ledger' language versions because they represent different ways the Cardano ledger handles them, not different versions of a programming language. They are essentially tags the ledger uses to differentiate how it processes validators in transactions.</s>"}
{"text": "<s>[INST] How does the 'ledger language version' impact the functionality of Plutus validators? [/INST] The 'ledger language version' impacts Plutus validators in three ways: 1) The ledger passes different arguments to validators based on the version. For example, Plutus V2 includes reference inputs, which were introduced after Plutus V1. 2) Newer versions currently have access to more builtin functions, though this is expected to change. 3) Compatibility with Plutus Core versions: Plutus Core 1.1.0 is only compatible with Plutus V3, while Plutus V1 and V2 use Plutus Core 1.0.0.</s>"}
{"text": "<s>[INST] When is a new 'ledger language version' introduced in Plutus? [/INST] A new 'ledger language version' is introduced when a new ledger era is rolled out, as this may involve changes to transactions and fields that necessitate new arguments for validators. Previously, new ledger language versions were also introduced for new builtin functions or Plutus Core versions, but this is no longer the case. Now, new ledger language versions are expected primarily for new ledger eras.</s>"}
{"text": "<s>[INST] What is the 'Plutus Core version' and how does it differ from the 'ledger language version'? [/INST] The 'Plutus Core version' refers to the version of the Plutus Core language itself, such as versions 1.0.0 and 1.1.0. Plutus Core 1.1.0 introduces new features like sums-of-products. This differs from the 'ledger language version', which relates to how the Cardano ledger processes different versions of Plutus validators. Adding new builtin functions does not require a new Plutus Core version, only new versions of Plutus Core itself.</s>"}
{"text": "<s>[INST] What is meant by 'builtin semantics variant' in Plutus? [/INST] The 'builtin semantics variant' refers to different behaviors of a builtin function depending on the protocol version or ledger language version. For example, the function consByteString behaves differently in Plutus V3 compared to earlier versions. The -S or --builtin-semantics-variant flag can be used with the uplc executable to specify which semantics variant to use during evaluation.</s>"}
{"text": "<s>[INST] How are Plutus Haskell packages versioned and where are they published? [/INST] Plutus Haskell packages, such as plutus-core, plutus-ledger-api, and plutus-tx-plugin, are versioned using a standard release versioning scheme. These packages are published on the Cardano Haskell Package repository (CHaP) rather than Hackage, which is Haskell's default package archive. The versioning of these packages is unrelated to the other notions of version discussed.</s>"}
{"text": "<s>[INST] What is the significance of the naming scheme 'Plutus V1', 'Plutus V2', and 'Plutus V3'? [/INST] The naming scheme 'Plutus V1', 'Plutus V2', and 'Plutus V3' is practically useful for indicating the order in which they were introduced and their relationships. Although these versions are treated as totally different languages by the Cardano ledger, they share similarities, such as using Plutus Core and being executed by the Plutus Core evaluator. This naming scheme helps in understanding their evolution and compatibility.</s>"}
{"text": "<s>[INST] Why does the 'ledger language version' not matter when writing standalone programs? [/INST] The 'ledger language version' does not matter when writing standalone programs because these programs are not directly affected by the ledger language version. You can write your code in Plutus Tx, compile it to UPLC, and run it with a UPLC evaluator without concerning yourself with whether it is Plutus V1, V2, or V3.</s>"}
{"text": "<s>[INST] What specific features are unique to each 'ledger language version'? [/INST] Each 'ledger language version' has unique features: Plutus V1 does not handle reference inputs, which were introduced in Plutus V2. Governance actions are only validated by Plutus V3, as they were introduced in the Conway era and are not supported in earlier versions. Additionally, newer versions have access to more builtin functions and different versions of Plutus Core.</s>"}
{"text": "<s>[INST] What changes are expected in the future regarding 'ledger language versions'? [/INST] In the future, introducing new builtin functions or new Plutus Core versions will no longer necessitate a new 'ledger language version'. New ledger language versions are expected primarily for new ledger eras, as these eras bring new or modified fields and transactions, requiring updated arguments for validators.</s>"}
{"text": "<s>[INST] How do 'Plutus Core versions' affect the Plutus language? [/INST] 'Plutus Core versions' affect the Plutus language by introducing new features and AST node types. For instance, Plutus Core version 1.1.0 adds sums-of-products with new AST node types: Case and Constr. However, adding new builtin functions does not require a new Plutus Core version.</s>"}
{"text": "<s>[INST] How do 'builtin semantics variants' impact the evaluation of Plutus scripts? [/INST] 'Builtin semantics variants' impact the evaluation of Plutus scripts by defining different behaviors for builtin functions depending on protocol or ledger language versions. For example, the consByteString function’s behavior changed in Plutus V3 to throw an exception for out-of-range values, whereas earlier versions would wrap around. The -S or --builtin-semantics-variant flag can specify which variant to use during evaluation.</s>"}
{"text": "<s>[INST] What is the role of the Cardano Haskell Package repository (CHaP) in Plutus? [/INST] The Cardano Haskell Package repository (CHaP) plays a role in hosting the Plutus Haskell packages, such as plutus-core, plutus-ledger-api, and plutus-tx-plugin. These packages follow a standard release versioning scheme and are published on CHaP instead of Hackage, which is the default package archive for Haskell. This versioning is independent of other versioning notions like ledger language versions or Plutus Core versions.</s>"}
{"text": "<s>[INST] What is the Plutus platform? [/INST] The Plutus platform is a platform for writing applications that interact with a distributed ledger, particularly the Cardano blockchain, which features scripting capabilities.</s>"}
{"text": "<s>[INST] Can you provide an example of an application that uses the Plutus platform? [/INST] An example application involves Alice and Bob engaging in an atomic swap of assets. Alice initiates the swap by requesting to exchange 50 Ada for her Special Token, and the application locks the token on the ledger. Bob is notified, agrees to the swap, and the application executes the swap by transferring assets and confirming completion to both parties.</s>"}
{"text": "<s>[INST] How does the Plutus platform facilitate an atomic swap between Alice and Bob? [/INST] Alice initiates the swap through the application, which interacts with the Cardano ledger to lock her token. Bob is notified and agrees to the swap. The application then processes the transaction and confirms the swap, ensuring that Bob cannot access Alice's token unless he completes the required action.</s>"}
{"text": "<s>[INST] Why is using the smart features of the ledger important in the Plutus platform? [/INST] The smart features of the ledger ensure that transactions are trustless and secure. They provide a way to enforce conditions for asset swaps without requiring a trusted third party, ensuring that parties meet their obligations.</s>"}
{"text": "<s>[INST] What complexities are involved in developing applications on the Plutus platform? [/INST] Developing applications on the Plutus platform involves complexities such as handling wallets, nodes, distributed systems issues like settlement delays, and managing state and synchronization. These challenges must be addressed to ensure the application's functionality and security.</s>"}
{"text": "<s>[INST] How does the Plutus platform handle security and trust issues in applications? [/INST] The Plutus platform uses smart contracts to create a trusted environment where conditions must be met for transactions to proceed. This eliminates the need for third-party trust, ensuring that transactions are secure and enforceable.</s>"}
{"text": "<s>[INST] What are some user experience considerations when developing applications on Plutus? [/INST] User experience considerations include managing application state, handling software upgrades, and ensuring proper synchronization. Even simple applications need to address these issues to avoid negatively impacting users' experience and funds.</s>"}

[/INST] Additional information about the Plutus platform can be found in the introduction by Michael Peyton-Jones and Jann Mueller from the Cardano 2020 event and the Plutus technical report that discusses the platform's design in detail.</s>"}
{"text": "<s>[INST] What does the ledger need to run an application’s trusted kernel of logic? [/INST] The ledger needs a way to specify and execute scripts. Since scripts are programs, this requires a programming language.</s>"},
{"text": "<s>[INST] What is Plutus Core? [/INST] Plutus Core is the low-level language used in the Plutus Platform. It is designed for simplicity, determinism, and careful cost control of program execution. Plutus Core is based on higher-order polymorphic lambda calculus and serves as the assembly language for the platform.</s>"},
{"text": "<s>[INST] Why is Plutus Core considered an assembly language? [/INST] Plutus Core is considered an assembly language because it is a low-level language designed to be written by a compiler and is the code that runs on-chain. It is validated by every node using an interpreter known as the CEK machine.</s>"},
{"text": "<s>[INST] What role does Plutus Core play in Cardano transactions? [/INST] A Plutus Core program included in a Cardano transaction is referred to as a Plutus script or Plutus validator. It is the code that performs validation and runs on-chain as part of the transaction processing.</s>"},
{"text": "<s>[INST] What is Plutus Tx? [/INST] Plutus Tx is a high-level language designed for writing the validation logic of contracts on the Cardano blockchain. It is a subset of Haskell that gets compiled into Plutus Core.</s>"},
{"text": "<s>[INST] How does Plutus Tx integrate with Haskell? [/INST] Plutus Tx is also a Haskell library that provides a compiler for writing Plutus smart contracts in Haskell. This allows developers to write secure and reliable contracts in Haskell and then compile them into Plutus Core for execution on the Cardano blockchain.</s>"},
{"text": "<s>[INST] What are the advantages of using Plutus Tx with Haskell? [/INST] Using Plutus Tx with Haskell allows for a seamless development process where part of the application code is compiled to Plutus Core for on-chain execution, while other parts remain in Haskell for off-chain use. This approach helps reduce errors by enabling libraries written with the Plutus Haskell SDK to share logic and data types across both parts of the application.</s>"},
{"text": "<s>[INST] How does Plutus Core ensure cost control and execution efficiency? [/INST] Plutus Core ensures cost control and execution efficiency through its design, which focuses on simplicity and determinism. This design helps in managing the resources required for executing Plutus scripts on-chain.</s>"}
{"text": "<s>[INST] What is the Plutus Platform designed to work with? [/INST] The Plutus Platform is designed to work with distributed ledgers, which are often implemented with blockchains like Cardano. However, the specifics of the underlying blockchain are often abstracted away.</s>"},
{"text": "<s>[INST] Why might applications need to care about the details of the underlying blockchain? [/INST] Applications might need to understand details like settlement time and rollback policies, as these factors can impact application behavior. The Plutus Application Framework attempts to shield developers from this complexity but can't always do so completely.</s>"},
{"text": "<s>[INST] What is a ledger in its simplest form? [/INST] In its simplest form, a ledger is a system that tracks ownership and balances of assets.</s>"},
{"text": "<s>[INST] How does a transaction affect the state of a ledger? [/INST] A transaction alters the state of the ledger by transferring assets from one party to another. For example, if Alice sends Bob 5 USD, Alice’s balance decreases while Bob’s balance increases.</s>"},
{"text": "<s>[INST] What are the two dominant paradigms for representing a ledger system? [/INST] The two dominant paradigms are account-based ledgers and UTXO-based ledgers.</s>"},
{"text": "<s>[INST] How do account-based ledgers work? [/INST] Account-based ledgers maintain a list of accounts and their balances. Transactions adjust these balances directly. This model can face challenges with global state issues and ordering problems affecting throughput.</s>"},
{"text": "<s>[INST] How do UTXO-based ledgers differ from account-based ledgers? [/INST] UTXO-based ledgers represent the ledger state as a set of unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs). Each UTXO is like an envelope with funds, and transactions spend UTXOs to create new ones. This model avoids some issues seen in account-based systems, such as global state conflicts.</s>"},
{"text": "<s>[INST] What is the Extended UTXO Model (EUTXO)? [/INST] The EUTXO model extends the basic UTXO model by allowing outputs to be locked by a script (pay-to-script) rather than just a public key (pay-to-pubkey). This script, known as a validator script, determines whether the transaction spending the output is authorized.</s>"},
{"text": "<s>[INST] What are the three arguments passed to validator scripts in the EUTXO model? [/INST] The three arguments are Datum (data attached to the output), Redeemer (data attached to the input), and Context (information about the transaction doing the spending).</s>"},
{"text": "<s>[INST] How might a validator script be used in an atomic swap? [/INST] In an atomic swap, the datum might contain the keys of the parties and swap details. The redeemer might be unused, while the context represents the transaction. The validator script checks if the transaction makes the correct payment before allowing the output to be spent.</s>"},
{"text": "<s>[INST] What kinds of validator scripts are currently available on the Cardano ledger? [/INST] The Cardano ledger includes simple scripts (e.g., time locks) introduced in the Allegra hard fork and various versions of ledger languages for different needs.</s>"}
