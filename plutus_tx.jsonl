},
{
    "prompt": "How do UTXO-based ledgers differ from account-based ledgers?",
    "response": "UTXO-based ledgers represent the ledger state as a set of unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs). Each UTXO is like an envelope with funds, and transactions spend UTXOs to create new ones. This model avoids some issues seen in account-based systems, such as global state conflicts."
},
{
    "prompt": "What is the Extended UTXO Model (EUTXO)?",
    "response": "The EUTXO model extends the basic UTXO model by allowing outputs to be locked by a script (pay-to-script) rather than just a public key (pay-to-pubkey). This script, known as a validator script, determines whether the transaction spending the output is authorized."
},
{
    "prompt": "What are the three arguments passed to validator scripts in the EUTXO model?",
    "response": "The three arguments are Datum (data attached to the output), Redeemer (data attached to the input), and Context (information about the transaction doing the spending)."
},
{
    "prompt": "How might a validator script be used in an atomic swap?",
    "response": "In an atomic swap, the datum might contain the keys of the parties and swap details. The redeemer might be unused, while the context represents the transaction. The validator script checks if the transaction makes the correct payment before allowing the output to be spent."
},
