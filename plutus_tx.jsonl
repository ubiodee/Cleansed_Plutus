[/INST] Using a subset of an existing language allows for the reuse of existing compiler components and language features, simplifying development by leveraging established tools and infrastructure.</s>"},
{"text": "<s>[INST] What is a potential issue when the new language and the host language do not agree on semantics or evaluation strategies? [/INST] Discrepancies in semantics or evaluation strategies can lead to inconsistencies in code behavior and idioms, where code may act differently in the new language compared to the host language.</s>"},
{"text": "<s>[INST] What is the main benefit of creating a standalone DSL from scratch? [/INST] The main benefit is the ability to design a language that is tailored specifically to its domain, avoiding limitations of existing languages and potentially creating a more elegant and intuitive tool for that domain.</s>"},
{"text": "<s>[INST] What is one major drawback of embedded DSLs compared to standalone DSLs? [/INST] Embedded DSLs expose users to the complexity of constructing and managing ASTs, which can increase cognitive load and complicate debugging and source code readability.</s>"},
{"text": "<s>[INST] How does Plutus Tx handle the conversion of Haskell code to UPLC? [/INST] Plutus Tx converts Haskell code to UPLC by utilizing a GHC plugin to transform GHC Core, which is an intermediate representation of Haskell, into UPLC.</s>"},
{"text": "<s>[INST] Describe a common approach to creating a shallow embedding in eDSLs. [/INST] A common approach in shallow embedding is using overloaded functions, which allow functions to operate with various implementations or types without constructing intermediate ASTs.</s>"},
{"text": "<s>[INST] What are the typical steps involved in designing a standalone DSL? [/INST] Designing a standalone DSL involves defining its syntax and semantics, and building all necessary compiler components such as lexers, parsers, type checkers, desugarers, and optimizers.</s>"},
{"text": "<s>[INST] What makes embedded DSLs easier to develop compared to standalone DSLs? [/INST] Embedded DSLs are easier to develop because they leverage the existing infrastructure and tools of the host language, such as its compiler and standard library, which reduces the need to build components from scratch.</s>"},
{"text": "<s>[INST] How does deep embedding differ from shallow embedding in terms of intermediate representation? [/INST] Deep embedding constructs and manipulates intermediate ASTs, while shallow embedding uses overloaded functions without creating intermediate ASTs.</s>"},
{"text": "<s>[INST] What are some of the benefits of using existing language features in subsets of existing languages? [/INST] Benefits include reusing existing functions, types, and idioms from the host language, which simplifies development and integration by leveraging well-established compiler components and language features.</s>"},
{"text": "<s>[INST] Why might standalone DSLs present a higher learning curve compared to embedded DSLs? [/INST] Standalone DSLs require users to learn a completely new language with its own syntax and semantics, while embedded DSLs build on existing languages, potentially reducing the learning curve for users familiar with the host language.</s>"}
